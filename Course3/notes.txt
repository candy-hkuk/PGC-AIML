step 1 and part of step 2

read df
check null
info
describe
check data type
outliers
drop the first column
release_date - convert into pandas date time
convert numerical columns to numeric and do correlation
do plots on album, release dates, popularity, duration ms
popularity with other columns - draw plots and explain your inference
look at data scatterness of "danceability", "energy", "valence", "tempo" - normal or uniform or skewed
correlation matrix

Step 2

PCA
Keep only necessary columns, reduce dimensionality to 2 (don't include popularity)
pc1 and pc2

for pc1 and pc2 do plot with hue of popularity

Keep only necessary columns, reduce dimensionality to 3 (don't include popularity)
pc1, pc2 and pc3

for pc1, pc2 and pc3 do plot with hue of popularity

eigenvalue, variance -
say whether each number of cluster suits the PCA

Step 3 clustering - on top of pca

k means ++
elbow and silhouette to come up with best cluster

hierarchical
say whats optimal based on hierarchy seen

db scan
with multiple cluster, plot the data and show them
